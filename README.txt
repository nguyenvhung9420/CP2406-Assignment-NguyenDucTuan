Light Cycle Game:

Run the Main, enter the name for each player, choose the color for the light cycle.

Movement:
Player1: arrow keys to move
Player2: W,S,A,D to move

This game is designed for multiplayer mode on a single PC. Since the server and client are not working, the game was designed differently from what planned in assignment1.

However, I personally think that this assignment motivates me to develop more advanced games in the future.
